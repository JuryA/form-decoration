# Form Decoration

The out-of-box form widget in Service Portal is extremely powerful, in that it leverages base-platform functionality so that forms can be designed by configuration rather than code. Examples of this functionality are as follows:

- Form views
- Dictionary 
- UI Policies
- Client Scripts
- UI Actions

It also has it's limitations as well. Specifically, there is no way out-of-box to style elements, or to add special functionality (e.g. Google address lookup). This means that while a portal can look good, it's appearance is often brought down by the inclusion of the form widget on the page.

This application is designed to easily allow you to style, and add custom functionality to form fields, whilst retaining the power of the out-of-box form widget.
